<p>After class, actively participate in some extracurricular activities and participate in the school's event planning, overcome introverted personality, and make yourself not panic in the face of many people. Learn more about the opinions of others on a daily basis, and don’t be stubborn, because other people’s suggestions are also very important. In ordinary life, cultivate one's self-cultivation and control one's emotions.</p>
